Thus, Teach To Lead has adopted this Child Protection Policy (CPP) requiring organisation representatives to conduct themselves appropriately with the children who participate in Teach To Lead related programmes as well as take reasonable measures to ensure the safety of such children.This policy aims to define the behaviours and actions that constitute child abuse. Additionally, it will lay out the organisations expectations for behaviour, the scope of application of the policy and guidelines for reporting and redressal.What constitutes child abuse?Child abuse or maltreatment constitutes all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual child abuse or maltreatment constitutes all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the childâs health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power (Source: A report of the consultation on child abuse prevention, WHO, Geneva, 29-31 March 1999, defines child abuse as).Teach To Lead Staff and Fellows must be aware of the following types of abuse and understand that they are prohibited as per this policy.Scope of Application of the Child Protection PolicyThis CPP is applicable to all part-time and full-time employees (including but not limited to Staff, Fellows, Interns) of Teach To Lead and any other person who has been bound to the Child Protection Policy as per their contractual agreement with Teach To Lead.This policy will be shared and explained to all school HMs/Lead teachers.Our government schools are governed by their respective state level Child Protection Policies.We will encourage our low income private schools to adopt this policy if they do not have a similar one of their own.Expected ConductExpected Behaviour and ActionsTreat every child with empathy and respect, regardless of their race, colour, gender, sexuality, language, religion, religious belief, heritage, political/ other opinion, national/ ethnic/ social origin or property/ disability/ birth/ other status.Listen to children and respect their views.Ensure that physical contact with a child is respectful, culturally appropriate and essential to the purpose of your interaction with the child.Establish an atmosphere that fosters the development of children through your actions and words.Always take permission from children before taking their photos or videos.Keep all personal information about children or their parents/guardians confidential and secure and ensure that such information is dispensed to only those individuals who are legitimately entitled to it.Attend all the applicable training sessions and workshops on the CPP and child-related laws conducted by the organization. Ensure you implement the lessons learned from such sessions and workshops.Prohibited Behaviour and ActionsDo not use language or behaviour towards children that is inappropriate, harassing, abusive, sexually provocative, demeaning, intimidating, offensive, discriminatory or culturally insensitive.Do not use any form of corporal punishment on children.Do not place a child in an environment where there is the risk of harm or abuse and do not harm or abuse any child physically, emotionally or sexually.Do not share with or show children (electronically or in any other form) inappropriate content including pornographic material or material encouraging crime, violence, terrorism, racism, sexism, self-harm, suicide, cruelty and gambling.Do not develop, induce or support physical or sexual relationships with children, in any way.Do not use or encourage the use of alcohol, drugs, cigarettes or other intoxicating substances while interacting with children or provide such intoxicating substances to children.Do not develop any form of relationship or arrangement (financial or otherwise) with children which could in any way be deemed to be exploitative or abusive. Do not use child labour in any form.Teach To Leadâs Measures to Prevent Child AbuseOn-Boarding Staff and Fellows:â¢ All Fellows and Staff must self declare previous cases of criminal offence and child mistreatment as part of their application to Teach To Lead.â¢ All Fellows and Staff will undergo child protection awareness training.â¢ Enforce child safety guidelines that are required to be followed by the Staff and Fellows during excursions, picnics and educational tours. Our Field Trip Policy is included in Annexure 6.â¢ Ensure that all Fellows and Staff sign a copy of the Child Protection Policy.â¢ Attempt to ensure that visitors to a school are accompanied by a Staff Member or a Fellow.â¢ Where the organisation undertakes any research on children or collects data on them, ensure that children are not harmed or traumatized in any way during the process.â¢ Partnerships to Support Implementation where possible - Partner with organisations to conduct age-appropriate sessions on the personal safety of Students (including modules/materials on body parts, online safety, protection from child abuse and services available for the protection of children). Partner with organisations working in the area of child abuse and child rights, to support Staff and Fellows in effective implementation of the CPP.âRedressal Mechanisms: Assigning responsibility to specific individuals or groups of individuals within the organisation to ensure procedures and arrangements are in place for effective implementation of the policy and redressal of child abuse complaints.These include:âCity Child Protection Officer (CCPO): This is the nodal person in every city to ensure compliance to the CPP. List of names and contact details of the CCPO is provided in Annexure 5. For any type of this policy, please reach out to your CCPO.âCity Child Protection Committee (CCPC): This is a committee in a city to help the CCPO with redressal decisions and will conduct reviews (once every 2 months) of the working of the CPP in the city and implement any additional measures to strengthen child protection measures.âNational Child Protection Officer (NCCPO): This is a person who oversees the policy at a national level to help the CCPCs with redressal decisions when escalated. He/she will conduct reviews (once every 3 months) of the working of the CPP in the organisation and implement any additional measures to strengthen child protection measures.The constitution, roles and responsibilities of CCPO, CCPC and NCCPO is provided in Annexure 3.There are 3 scenarios under which the Child Protection Policy can be violated. The guidelines set out in this section will govern the reporting and redressal of each of the respective scenarios: - Where the alleged victim is any child (Teach To Lead or non-Teach To Lead) and the alleged offender is a Staff or Fellow - Where the alleged victim is a Teach To Lead student and the alleged offender is not a Staff or Fellow. - Where the alleged victim can be any child and the alleged offender is anybody and where the offence is one of sexual abuse.For Guidelines on Complaint Redressal Mechanism and additional informationClick hereQuick LinksThe ED CrisisOur ImpactThe FellowshipAbout Teach For IndiaInnovatEDApplyFAQsDonateChild Protection PolicyFor AlumniVolunteerContactFinancialsHow To Be A Fellow Privacy PolicyTerms Of UseRefund PolicyWork With USFAQCONTACTCHILD PROTECTION POLICYFINANCIALSPRIVACY POLICYTERMS OF USEStay ConnectedSign up with your email to receive latest updates on Teach For India.Thank you!

We help entrepreneurs who want to take their innovations from the project or prototype stage to a sustainable organisation.InnovatED in actionInnovatEd is a nine-month incubation platform that has three primary modes of engagement: physical, virtual, and digital. The physical (in-person) component includes a series of national innovation bootcamps and optional visits from the coach or the InnovatED team; the virtual component includes monthly cohort calls and webinars, and the digital component includes micro-learning videos and our in-house learning platform: InnovatED Insights. Beyond this, InnovatED provides a stipend and coaching support to entrepreneurs.Read about the InnovatED story + What is InnovatED's long term vision?Our vision is to create an interconnected community of education entrepreneurs across India. A community that will learn from and support each other during and beyond the incubation journey. One that creates a new narrative for education in the country.Register for InnovatED 25\"InnovatED has been an incredible experience.

The 60 countries in the network today share a common vision of an excellent education for all children.Theory of ChangeMeaningful change happens when we cultivate a collective force of leaders. Driven by the vision of an India free of poverty and filled with love, our leaders choose education as the path to get there. Over the next decade, we aspire to build a movement of 50,000 leaders. They will work collectively, with love, to transform the lives of 1 in 10 children from low-income communities in and beyond our regions.We Build LeadersWe find committed people for our two-year Fellowship. We place them in low-income or government schools where they work relentlessly to transform the lives of their students. We support them as they find careers within and beyond the education sector.We Nurture A Movement Of LeadersAfter the Fellowship, our Fellows have lifelong access to our Alumni movement. This close-knit, supportive community learns and acts together for educational equity.Within EducationOur Alumni work to transform schools and communities, join or start organisations to support education and work within government.Beyond EducationOur Alumni work in careers in research, law, media, government and business and find ways to continue to advocate for educational equity.Transformational Schools: They choose to be teachers, teacher trainers and leaders in schools or community centres.Enablers of Transformational Schools: They support schools through curriculum, assessment reform, large-scale teacher training, and ed tech.Policy and Governance: They work on policy and governance issues, supporting governments directly on large-scale systemic reforms in education.InnovationsWhile Teach For India's Flagship programme is the two-year Teach For India Fellowship, we also run other programmes to build leadership.If you are a Pre-service educator, a Teacher, a Teacher Coach or a School Leader:Firki is an online teacher development portal which has courses aligned to content and pedagogy and carefully curated resources. Firki runs online learning programs for pre-service educators, teachers, school leaders and coaches in partnership with organisations and educational institutions.If you have completed your Teach For India Fellowship and An Early-Stage Entrepreneur:InnovatED is a platform for training and supporting entrepreneurs looking to build impactful organisations in education. It helps early-stage education entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of establishing and sustaining a new organisation, enabling them to create an impact.If you are a Student:The Kids Education Revolution is a platform for students and educators to reimagine education by building student voice, partnership and leadership.If you are an Education Entrepreneur:TFIx is an incubator for education entrepreneurs across India who aspire to launch their own contextualised versions of Teach For India's Fellowship to serve vulnerable children in their region.If you are a Government Official:Our Government Relations vertical looks for opportunities to place Alumni within the government to work on education projects. We offer a range of Student and teacher resources that can be used at scale to reimagine education. We thought-partner with the government on educational leadership and Student voice.Quick LinksThe ED CrisisOur ImpactThe FellowshipAbout Teach For IndiaInnovatEDApplyFAQsDonateChild Protection PolicyFor AlumniVolunteerContactFinancialsHow To Be A Fellow Privacy PolicyTerms Of UseRefund PolicyWork With USFAQCONTACTCHILD PROTECTION POLICYFINANCIALSPRIVACY POLICYTERMS OF USEStay ConnectedSign up with your email to receive latest updates on Teach For India.Thank you!
