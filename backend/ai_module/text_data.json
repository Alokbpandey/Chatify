What does the Teach For India Fellowship entail. The Fellowship is a 2-year, full-time, paid commitment. Fellows are placed in under-resourced English-medium classrooms in a government or low-income private school. Fellows work as subject/class teachers for a set of 40-80 Students, where they: - take responsibility for students' academic and holistic learning outcomes growth. - empower and enable the parents of Students. - collaborate with school faculty and staff to create a conducive learning environment for all Students and learn about the grassroots challenges and enablers. Fellows work closely with other Fellows and staff members to learn, facilitate, and enable each other's leadership development and growth. Fellows embark on their own leadership development journey where they:Â - practice skills and traits of leadership through their daily work, reflective spaces, coaching conversations, and feedback loops. - plan, execute and monitor their work while mobilising stakeholders regularly. - drive a \"Be The Change Project\" - an entrepreneurial project rooted in solving daily challenges their Students encounter.

Â How will the Teach For India experience help me grow professionally. Through the Fellowship, you will learn transferable leadership skills and traits, including the following:Â Connect : As you work closely with other teachers, parents, school staff and your Students, you will learn to listen deeply, empathise, and build strong relationships. Envision : As you envision a bold, new future for your children, you will learn to dream big for yourself and others. Plan : As you plan for Students at different levels with a wide range of needs and interests, you will learn advanced planning, organisational and time management skills. Execute : As you learn to teach Students to learn in ways that meet their varied learning styles, you will discover a range of communication, management and team skills. â Reflect : As you pause to see where your Students have progressed and ask what you might have done better in and beyond class, you will learn to reflect deeply and make meaning of every challenge and opportunity.

Other Questions Can I be engaged in any external professional or academic engagement during the course of the Fellowship. The Fellowship is a two-year full-time commitment. We do not permit our Fellows to be involved in any other external professional or academic engagements during their Fellowship. Can I defer my place in the Fellowship.

      "text": "InnovatED Frequently Asked Questions We answer the most common questions about InnovatED below. | Selection and Eligibility | Incubation | InnovatED LaunchPad | Resources Selection and Eligibility What does the selection process for InnovatED look like. What type of organisations are eligible for InnovatED. Can an organisation with a for-profit model apply to InnovatED. Social-impact organisations with a not-for-profit, a for-profit model, or a hybrid model that have completed at least one pilot can apply to InnovatED. You are eligible if your organisation fundamentally shifts life outcomes for India's children from low-income families. Does InnovatED look for a specific focus within education. Yes, having applied earlier has no bearing on your application this year. Every application is looked at as a fresh one. I don't have a team or a co-founder. We will be incubating individual entrepreneurs in any case, not their teams. However, given how challenging it is to run an organisation alone, we recommend you consider getting a co-founder or a core team at some point. We still need to formally register as an organisation. Yes, you do not need to be an incorporated organisation to apply. You only need a prototype (tangible proof of your work on the ground, underpinned by solid research). It just needs to be more than simply an idea in your head. Our organisation is already part of another funding/incubation programme. If it is a funding programme which does not require you to spend significant time attending events/components of the other programme, it should work out fine. If you're already part of another part-time/full-time incubation program, we might have to understand your availability before deciding on your candidature. In any case, we would love to hear a disclosure about the same during the application process so we can take a call on a case-specific basis. Is there an ideal kind of applicant for InnovatED. We are looking for early-stage entrepreneurs with more than just an idea (you must have tested the idea in some form at least, possibly through a prototype or pilot). You need to be a Teach For India Alumnus / Alumna (Fellowship / Staff), willing to work full-time and working on a problem that directly relates to educational inequity. What happens if the team has people from outside Teach For India. The team can definitely have people from outside Teach For India (diversity has its advantages). However, the incubated entrepreneur needs to be a Teach For India Alumnus or Alumna. Incubation Is InnovatED a full-time commitment. To be incubated, you must be working full-time in your early-stage organisation. If you are currently employed, you should be ready to leave your existing engagement and work on your organisation full-time to be eligible for InnovatED. Can I attend a part of InnovatED. InnovatED is an 9 month full-time engagement. If selected, you must commit to being present for all parts of it - in-person convenings, monthly cohort calls, or any other aspect of the engagement. Entrepreneurs are required to commit to 100% attendance across components of InnovatED. What does InnovatED look like in action. Beyond this, InnovatED provides a stipend and coaching support to entrepreneurs. Â What is the format of InnovatED. InnovatED is a decentralised incubation platform and most interactions, except for the boot camps, happen online. Based on the conditions closer to the event dates, we will take a call about events happening online/offline. What happens after the 9 months. As an Alumnus or Alumna of InnovatED, you will graduate into the larger collective of InnovatED entrepreneurs you can lean on for learning, collaboration and support. In addition, the InnovatED team will strive to support you on a case-by-case basis to the best of our ability. What is the stipend amount. Based on past figures, the stipend amount will likely be around INR 50,000 per month (with 10% TDS). Â What are other funding opportunities from InnovatED. Entrepreneurs will have access to an Innovation Fund corpus of 8. Based on their Innovation Proposals, this fund will be disbursed to 3-4 select cohort entrepreneurs. In addition, there will be a Demo Day with donors and InnovatED partners during the national Summit for you to access funding, forward connects, and feedback. Can my team get incubated. InnovatED primarily aims at individual entrepreneurs (you must nominate one person from your early-stage team). We will support that individual to develop the necessary capacity, knowledge and connections to help the rest of the team and the organisation going forward. Will I need to move locations for being incubated. No, InnovatED is not a physical incubator but a decentralised incubation platform. You will work from your respective location and might need to travel only for the national innovation boot camps. Do I need to make travel and stay arrangements for boot camps if they are in-person. InnovatED takes care of the travel and accommodation for its incubatees for all boot camps it hosts. InnovatED Launchpad I am an InnovatED Launchpad cohort entrepreneur. Can I apply to InnovatED. Yes, Launchpad entrepreneurs can apply to InnovatED. However, we do not have any pre-booked seats for Launchpad entrepreneurs. Suppose a Teach For India Alumni who has not been incubated by InnovatED Launchpad is a co-founder. In that case, we encourage them to apply on behalf of your organisation. â Is the selection process for InnovatED Launchpad entrepreneurs different. Launchpad entrepreneurs will have to go through the same application stages to make the application process fair for all applicants. How is InnovatED different from InnovatED Launchpad. InnovatED is an 9 months incubation platform versus the 6-7 weeks pre-incubation platform for InnovatED Launchpad. Additional support components are provided to InnovatED entrepreneurs, like the monthly stipend, in-person boot camps, and site visits. Will the content covered in InnovatED Launchpad boot camps be the same as InnovatED boot camps. The boot camps are designed to cater to the entrepreneurs' needs at that point. The topics covered in a boot camp will be based on the identified needs and challenges of the cohort entrepreneurs. Resources Are there any resources that I can refer to gain more clarity about the program. Refer to The InnovatED Story or follow us on our social media handles ( Instagram , Facebook , Twitter ) and Youtube channel to learn more about InnovatED and the incubated entrepreneurs. I have some more questions. You can reach out to us for further information at innovated@teachforindia. Your submission has been received. Something went wrong while submitting the form.

We understand that the first few years of building an organisation are challenging â be it creating a value proposition, raising funds or hiring talent.

Children living in poverty are often the worst hit by these statistics, with their education â and therefore their life choices, being severely affected.
